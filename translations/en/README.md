When you clone the project, several files will be missing (.gitignore) such as :
>
> - [x] Database configuration and dependencies (you'll have to configure these yourself).
> - [x] Dependencies, you can install modules with NPM (look in the imports at the beginning of each file).
> - [x] Environment configuration files (.env, .env.local, etc.), which contain sensitive information such as API keys and environment-specific configurations.
> - [x] Cache and log files (/var and /vendor folders) which are automatically generated and must not be versioned.
> - [x] Test files (phpunit.xml, .phpunit.result.cache) which are specific to the development environment.
> - [x] Files generated by database migrations (doctrine_migration_*.sql) which are specific to each database instance.
>
